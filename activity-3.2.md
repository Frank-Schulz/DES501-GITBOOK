# Activity 3.2

The Agile model is designed to be more, as it's name suggests, flexible, and allows for the direction of development to change more easily. It also facilitates a lot more communication between developers and end user/s, allowing for closer ties and is more likely to result in a product that meets the requirements of the end user.

The agile model works best for smaller projects, as it divides the development cycle into smaller chunks, but does work for larger projects as well.
