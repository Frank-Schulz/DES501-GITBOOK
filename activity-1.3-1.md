**Making use of IT in the business environment**  
Businesses can use IT for multiple things, depending on the need.  
This could include:  
**Marketing**  
Spreading awareness of their service/product quickly and easily

**Improved communication**  
Quick and easy communication both within the businesses and without. eg With businesses partners, customers, etc

**Streamlining workflow, improving efficiency and Cost reduction**  
Automating certain tasks means that a business can get repetitive tasks done quickly and easily with little to no human involvement. Allowing that effort to be used elsewhere.
