# Activity 1.5

Information technology can significantly affect the strategic options, opportunities and issues in many aspects of business. Some of the key impacts of technology are:

* business strategy
* organisational culture
* organisational structure
* business processes
* the nature of work
* the workplace

You are required to:

1. Do your own web research on all of the above.
2. Discuss how they can be impacted by technology.

**Business strategy:**  
The Business Strategy, or plan, could be impacted by technology in a number of ways, depending on what technology is used and how much is implemented.  
For example: A company might use technology to monitor it's operations; track its goals or monitor its target market and its position within that market.

**Organisational culture:**  
The Organisational culture, or the culture within an organisation, can be affected in ways such as: How communication takes place, both internally and externally of the organisation; changing the relationship dynamics within the organisation, as well as potentially changing any other culture related aspect.

**Note:**  
The real world results of adding technology to these different organisational parts could vary \(even wildly\), as the final result depends on many factors that would need to be analysed on an individual basis.  
As such my answers are, and should only be considered as, examples of how the addition of technology might affect these organisational parts.
