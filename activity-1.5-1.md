# Activity 1.5

Information technology can significantly affect the strategic options, opportunities and issues in many aspects of business. Some of the key impacts of technology are:

* business strategy
* organisational culture
* organisational structure
* business processes
* the nature of work
* the workplace

You are required to:

1. Do your own web research on all of the above.
2. Discuss how they can be impacted by technology.

**Business strategy:**  
The Business Strategy, or plan, could be impacted by technology in a number of ways, depending on what technology is used and how much is implemented.  
For example: A company might use technology to monitor it's operations; track its goals or monitor its target market and its position within that market.

**Organisational culture:**  
The Organisational culture, or the culture within an organisation, can be affected in ways such as: How communication takes place, both internally and externally of the organisation; changing the relationship dynamics within the organisation, as well as potentially changing any other culture related aspect.

**Organisational structure:**  
Will Kenton \(9th Feb 2020\) explains on [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/organizational-structure.asp) that the organisational structure determines how an organisation goes about achieving its goals and how the intercommunication of the organisation should function.

Through the addition of technology, the intercommunication dynamic within an organisation would surely change \(perhaps become more direct\). New rules would have to be made and old ones revisited, the same could apply to the roles as well the responsibilities within that organisation.

**Business processes:**  
Also known as business methods, business processes refer to tasks or activities undertaken by either technology or people to provide a user/consumer with a service or product, as stated on [Techopedia](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/1168/business-process) \(January 24, 2017\).

This has the potential to change dramatically, though it depends on the individual business. This sector is where automation can really shine, cutting down on time and running costs. Consequently this also causes it to be one the sectors that sees a higher number of job cuts, as repetitive tasks are more efficiently and cheaply completed by technology.

**The nature of work:**  
This sector is practically defined by \(and exists because of\) the other sectors, as it is largely a by-product of them. This sector encapsulates the who, where, when, what and how of an individuals work within a business, though the primary focus is on the what.

**The workplace:**  
The physical location/s of where the organisations employees do their work.  
Any potential changes in this sector are **highly** dependant on not only the organisation itself but also the individual employees job or current task.  
Technology most often changes existing elements already present within the workplace or adds new ones. However in some cases it can change the location, like allowing for work to be done remotely. For example using an application like Team Viewer to work on a clients PC without needing to be "onsite".



**Note:**  
The real world results of adding technology to these different organisational parts could vary \(even wildly\), as the final result depends on many factors that would need to be analysed on an individual basis.  
As such my answers are, and should only be considered as, examples of how the addition of technology might affect these organisational parts.
