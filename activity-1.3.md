1. Discuss in the Forum how having roles focused entirely on forward-thinking innovation within an IT business might affect the structure of that business.

Good for future proofing ,   
Competing edge;

By having a team dedicated to innovation you can let them focus on creating new ideas to propel the company into the future, this way you needn't reallocate your work-force and 'waste time'  when ever your looking to innovate.

Taking this a step further:  
Decentralising the creative process, aka opening the floor to any staff member to submit ideas for innovation in the company, allows the creative team to reallocate time spent on making ideas to instead filtering those given to them.  
This is the approach adopted by PCI \(Project Concern International\), they named this internal process: "PCInnovAtion".

_"Thatâ€™s why they created_ [_PCInnovAtion_](https://www.pciglobal.org/what-it-means-to-be-a-global-leader-in-innovation/)_, an internal process that allows any staff member to submit an idea, have it vetted, receive support and guidance, and move forward from idea to prototype. To date, the organization has created over 100 innovations through this process."_
