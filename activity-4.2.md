# Activity 4.2



As you have learnt, usability is one important aspect of user experience design.

1. **Research and discuss how usability and user experience differ from one another.** Usability is all about ease of use of a site, whereas UX is about the experience while using the site. Clearly there is overlap here, if something is usable it's more likely to be an enjoyable experience. Similarly, something that is hard to use is not enjoyable. 
2. **Decide on the things to be considered when assessing the usability of a system?**[https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/)

   According to Jakob Nielson, the '5 quality components' of usability \(as written in the above article: 'Usability 101: Introduction to Usability', January 3, 2012\) are:  
   1\) **Learnability**  
   2\) **Efficiency**  
   3\) **Memorability**  
   4\) **Errors**  
   5\) **Satisfaction**  
   The above list is self explanatory, but...:  
   Using the above list we can see that we must evaluate these points when assessing a systems usability. It must be easy to learn; everything we do adds to our mental load, making our system as easy as possible to learn lessens the mental load making the site more enjoyable to use.  
   The system must do what it's meant to do in the first place and do it well, otherwise there is little point in trying to use it at all.  
   If the system isn't memorable and people forget it, then they won't remember to come back.  
   Errors... a very broad topic but they all lead back to one thing, an with the system; this is true whether is a direct system error or the user making an error due to a lack of clarity from the system.  
   Lastly if a user isn't happy with the experience of using the system, then they will try to find a system that they are happy with.  

3. Find at least one example of a system \(e.g. website, mobile app, etc.\) that demonstrates good usability and one with poor usability. Take screenshots to aid in explaining your reasoning for coming to these conclusions.
