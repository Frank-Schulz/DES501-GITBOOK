# Activity 6.3

There are many aspects to learning how to write effectively for the web, so much so that it could easily form an entire course in it's own right. As an introduction, however, carry out your own research on each of the below and place your findings into the Forum. Check out what other students have discovered

The importance of:

1. **knowing your audience** Knowing your audience is crucial if you want your writing to appeal to them. If your content doesn't interest them then they will move on. Hence if you know your audience then you know what it is that they will enjoy reading
2. **understanding how people read on the web "**They don't. People rarely read Web pages word by word; instead, they scan the page, picking out individual words and sentences.**"** \(Jakob Nielsen, 1997\) By knowing how people read on the web we can match our writing style to the way that people will read it; which, as Jakob Niesen explains, is by scanning the page. So what writers need to do is to make their writing, scanning compatible.
3. **following the 'inverted pyramid' model** Starting with the conclusion, allows readers to quickly see what the the topic is but the main point is to get the reader hooked. By reading the conclusion the reader is likely to wonder how and why this conclusion was reached and so is more likely to read on. This \(along with the following points\) makes a piece of writing more scanning compatible.
4. **keeping content short and simple** By keeping writing short and simple, it's made easy to read and therefore more likely to be read. A point is made and explained without trying to keep the readers attention for longer than is necessary. 
5. **chunking content** By chunking the content, related information is grouped \(or chunked\) together, making the writing easier and faster to read.
6. **using the active voice** Sentences will be more to the point and therefore shorter and easier to read when using the active voice. These sentences are written in a context in which the subject acts.
7. **putting content into context** Providing context gives more information about \(and often provides an explanation to\) an action or situation, which may be though to have a different meaning without the context.
8. **editing and proofreading** Editing makes use of the above points to make a piece of writing as legible as possible and makes sure that it's sending the intended message. Proofreading is final error check to remove any errors in spelling, punctuation, etc.
