description: What makes a good web experience?

# Activity 6.1

This is a group activity. As a group:

Discuss what you think makes for a good web experience. Draw on your own experiences and preferences.

Good Contrast  
Good layout \(easy to read / find things\)  
Good UX design with good UI design to back it up  
Readable fonts  
Interesting everything aka relevance  
Organised  
Accessible \(usable by those with impairments\)

Consider the different opinions of group members. Does it seem that things like age, culture, previous experience makes a difference?

**Age:**  
Elderly people generally will prefer a site with large fonts and headings as they are easier to read. They are likely also interested in a large range of topics.

Children will likely be more attracted to a site with bright colours and a large focus on UX many interactive images than someone older.

A middle aged person will probably prefer a design with functional elements that do not clutter the screen and achieve the outcome they are looking for.  


**Culture:**  
Max - I couldn’t think of culture making a huge difference between sites as the content will largely reflect the UI or UX and that will be more of a drawer for varying cultures

Frank - I find that culture \(in my personal experience\) is not very prominent on the web, and when it is, it’s usually towards a targeted audience.   


**Previous Experience:**  
Someone that has experience with a particular sites design standard will generally prefer sites that match that standard. Also, someone with more general web experience will likely have an easier time navigating sites and having a general idea of their use.
